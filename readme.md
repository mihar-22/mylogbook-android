# Mylogbook

Mylogbook allows Australian learner drivers to record and organise their logbook digitally. The application aims to make the process less painful in comparison to the paper system by:

* Storing and personalising reusable data such as supervisors and cars.
* Calculating missing information when logging such as the time taken and odometer readings.
* Automatically tracking conditions such as the route and weather.
* Providing a simple dashboard for keeping track of progression towards probationary licence.
* Keeping data safe by storing it safely in the cloud and maintaining backups.
* Reducing cheating by recording the trip with the phones GPS and requiring digital supervisor approval.
* Up-to-date notifications on best practices and changes to road rules and safety or the learner system.

This is **not for public release** and it's used **only for prototyping and testing** the idea. This is not the codebase that will be used for production.
