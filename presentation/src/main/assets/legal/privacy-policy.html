        Our primary objective is to organize, record and present the information required
        to obtain your Australian provisional licence. It is made available as a service to you
        through any software offered by us.
    </p>

    <p>Here we will describe:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>What Information we collect and why we collect it</li>
        <li>How we use information we collect</li>
        <li>Information we share</li>
        <li>Information security</li>
        <li>Changes</li>

    <h1 class="strong">Information we collect</h1>

    <p>We collect the following information to provide and improve our service to you.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <span class="strong">Account.</span> We require you to sign up
            for a Mylogbook Account to use our service. When you do, we’ll ask for personal
            information like your name, email address and birthdate. This information helps
            us improve and personalize your user experience. Your email is used to: identify you,
            notify you of events or updates, take advantage of security features and to send you
            resources.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="strong">Local.</span> While using our service, various
            data you provide is stored locally on your device. This includes: the date you received
            your learner’s permit, the current state you reside in and information you provide about
            your progression towards your provisional licence. The exact information you provide will
            vary slightly depending on the state you reside in. This data is collected to aid us in
            providing our service to the best of our ability and as accurately as possible, ultimately
            providing a better user experience.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="strong">Service.</span> Our service allows you to create cars,
            supervisors and logs. It includes your car registration numbers and supervisor names. A log is
            a recording of a trip taken as a learner driver from a starting point to a final destination.
            Information about your trip is recorded with data you provide and information we collect in the
            background. We collect data with the global positioning system (GPS) technology on your phone
            and we may use third-party services to obtain more information as required. This includes: start
            and end time, your cars odometer, distance travelled, weather, traffic, road types, light
            conditions, start and end geographic coordinates, start and end locations, time zone, the car
            you used and the supervisor instructing you. This information is stored in a local database
            and synced to our database online. This information is collected solely to provide and improve
            our service.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="strong">Usage.</span> We may collect information on how you
            use the service and your experience using it. This includes actions you take in your account,
            system activity, crashes and errors. We may also collect device-specific information such as
            the unique device identifier (UID), operating system version and hardware model. This information
            is to help us improve our service.
        </li>
